Project Title
Bayesian Linear Regression Model on Predicting the Relationship of Urbanization and Beetles

Description
This project investigates the ecological impact of urbanization on beetle species richness using Bayesian and Poisson regression models. It utilizes data collected from 13 sites in New York City, categorizing habitats as urban, suburban, or rural and incorporating impervious surface coverage as a key variable. The study demonstrates the ability to predict beetle species abundance based on habitat types and urbanization levels.

Key Features
Data Source: Beetle species data from Fusco et al. (2017).
Methodology: Poisson regression model applied to predict species abundance.
Variables: Habitat type and impervious surface coverage.
Results: The model shows a strong predictive relationship but is limited by the small dataset size (N=15).
